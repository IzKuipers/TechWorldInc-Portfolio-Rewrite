    <p>ArcOS is a super advanced virtual desktop environment made in Electron. It has been in
        development since February 17th, 2021, and the ArcOS team is working day in day out to make ArcOS the best
        we possibly can. It has a modular application loading system, allowing you to load your own applications, themes,
        many built-in applications to get you started which include a file manager, terminal (ArcTerm), notepad, App Manager,
        Settings, and more, ready to assist you. ArcOS is built using Electron, making it even more advanced than it could've been.
        The current supported operating systems that ArcOS can run on are Windows and Linux. This doesn't mean it won't run on MacOS,
        this only means that we haven't tested the functionality of ArcOS under the conditions of MacOS. <br><br>
