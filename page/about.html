    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Izaak Kuipers, a hobbyist developer since I was young. I have been interested<br>
        in this topic since the age of 6, and have grown to know a lot about it since.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        Over the years I have learned a lot of skills, of which my biggest one is web development, using HTML, CSS and
        JS.<br>
        Since the beginning of 2021 I learned about Electron, and I have created a lot of great projects in it
        since,<br>
        with more to come in the future. My main Electron project is ArcOS, a Operating System Environment that runs<br>
        on top of Windows or Linux, like how Windows used to run on top of MS-DOS.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        But web development is not my only skill, I also know a lot about the Windows operating system, of which the<br>
        greater part was self-taught. I use this knowledge to help my friends and family, and other people that
        request<br>
        my help. I know e.g. what system files are required to run Windows, how the images are<br>
        stored inside the DLL files, and more.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        So, if you want to know what I have managed to create over time, head on over to my projects page, which will
        list<br>
        mainly the bigger projects nicely on display for you to enjoy. Have fun experimenting for yourself, and let me
        know<br>
        what you think about this website!
